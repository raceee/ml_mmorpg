## Intro

Character creation in Dungeons and Dragons is a fun gameplay mechanic that forces parties of players to act creatively limited by the strengths and weaknesses of the character they were able to make themselves. Naturally, D&D's conceptual offspring would keep this gameplay feature and result in the international sucess - World of Warcraft. However, since the games launch in 2004 the freedom to choose has evolved to a ideological contridiction. While players are still free to choose, the community has socially optimized a few combinations of character types that will produce the most winning outcomes, creating a social constriction called 'meta'.

In this repo we use machine learning algorithms in an effort to shatter meta - freeing players to choose how they would like to play, simulating the ignorance that made things fun in 2004.
1. Bosses now eliminate and fit to counter the 'meta'
2. Bosses are not static and cannot be 'socially optimized'
3. Victory is contingent on preparation, not only by watching 7 minute guides on youtube about how to win
4. Players cannot win by themselves
